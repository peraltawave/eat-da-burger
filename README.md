Eat Da Burger! Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars.

**Description**
This application demonstrates a  full stack application with a front-end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. 

HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

User enters any burger name (including repeats) to add it to the menu. 

The application adds this info to a MySql database.

The burger is added as available on the menu. 

The user may then eat any burger by clicking the 'Eat Me' button.

This moves any available burger into the 'devoured' column in the db and updates its status to 'devoured = true'
